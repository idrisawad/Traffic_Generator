# Traffic_Generator #

This is a traffic generator script that utilizes web browsers to open multiple windows and access a specific URL. The script uses a list of proxies stored in a text file, "proxies.txt", to access the target URL. The script removes any newline characters from the proxies and sets the target URL, number of windows to open, and the time delay between opening each window. The script then uses a counter to iterate through the proxies list and opens the target URL with a specific proxy in a new window. The script will continue to open new windows and access the target URL with different proxies until the specified number of windows is reached.

### Before You Begin: ###

 1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

 2. Create a text file named "proxies.txt" in the same directory as the script. This file will contain a list of proxies that the script will use to access the target URL.

 3. Add a list of proxies to the "proxies.txt" file, one proxy per line. Make sure that the proxies are valid and not banned.

 4. Download the "Traffic Generator" script and save it in the same directory as the "proxies.txt" file.

### Using the Script: ###

 1. Open the script in a text editor and edit the "target_url" variable to the desired URL you want to generate traffic to.

 2. Set the "num_windows" variable to the number of windows you want to open. This variable controls the number of browser windows that will be opened to access the target URL.

 3. Set the "wait_time" variable to the number of seconds you want to wait between opening each window. This variable controls the time delay between opening each browser window.

 4. Save the script and run it by using the command "python traffic_generator.py" in the command prompt or terminal.

 5. The script will open multiple windows and access the target URL with different proxies from the "proxies.txt" file.

 6. Once the script has finished running, you can check your website's traffic to see if it has increased.

### Troubleshooting: ###

 1. Make sure that Python is installed on your computer and that the script is located in the same directory as the "proxies.txt" file.

 2. Make sure that the "proxies.txt" file contains valid proxies and that each proxy is on a separate line.

 3. Make sure that the "target_url" variable is set to the correct URL.

 4. If the script is not running properly, try running it in the command prompt or terminal as an administrator.

 5. If the script is still not working, try re-downloading the script and following the instructions again.
